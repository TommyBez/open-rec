# This directory contains external binaries bundled with the app
# 
# To set up ffmpeg for development:
#
# 1. Download a static ffmpeg build for your platform:
#    - macOS ARM64: https://evermeet.cx/ffmpeg/ or brew install ffmpeg
#    - macOS x64: https://evermeet.cx/ffmpeg/
#
# 2. Copy/rename the ffmpeg binary with the correct target triple suffix:
#    - macOS ARM64: ffmpeg-aarch64-apple-darwin
#    - macOS x64: ffmpeg-x86_64-apple-darwin
#
# 3. Make sure the binary is executable:
#    chmod +x ffmpeg-*
#
# Note: Static builds are preferred to avoid dynamic library issues.
